-- | @LoopT m a@ represents a loop over a base type @m@ that yields a value
-- @a@ at each iteration. It can be used as a monad transformer, but there
-- are actually no restrictions on the type @m@. However, this library only
-- provides functions to execute the loop if @m@ is at least 'Applicative'
-- (for 'exec_'). If @m@ is also 'Foldable', so is @LoopT m@. For any other
-- type, you may use 'runLoopT'.

-- | @Loop@ is a pure loop, without side-effects.
type Loop = LoopT Identity

-- | @loop@ is just an aid to type inference. For loops over a base monad,
-- there are usually other constraints that fix the type, but for pure
-- loops, the compiler often has trouble inferring @Identity@.
